### Summary
ClassStatus notifies college students of class cancellations via text message and email. This helps students save time, money, and energy by helping them avoid commuting to cancelled classes. Our customers are college students interested in making their lives easier.

Almost all colleges in the United States notify students of class cancellations via email, this is ineffective as most students don't check their email right before class resulting in the student wasting time showing up to said canceled class

ClassStatus fixes this problem by switching the method of notification: text messaging. Students who use ClassStatus will not only receive an email notification but also a text message guaranteeing that as long as the student has their phone, they'll always know when there class is canceled.
